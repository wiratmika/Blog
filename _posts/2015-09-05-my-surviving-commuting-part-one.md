No doubt commuting is an utterly repetitive and tedious part of our life. Still, it can become more bearable with good tunes to accompany you through the endless traffic jam or smelly armpits in the metro. Here I present to you the first part of a non-exhaustive list of splendid albums I listen to countless times during my commute, in no particular order.

## Tigapagi - Roekmana's Repertoire (2013)

This is my definition of a near-perfect Indonesian folk-pop album. Roekmana's Repertoire combines the familiar Sundanese pentatonic scale, haunting melodies, and beautiful orchestration that will drown you and take you to the skies simultaneously. I was amazed when I opened the packaging because it was so gorgeous. It is saddening to know it is sold only at Rp 30k-ish; I believe the artists deserve more.

## Sean Lennon - Friendly Fire (2006)

This is the album I wish I could make if I ~~have musical talents~~ took formal and expensive musical training when I was younger. It has unusually melancholic chords, enchanting lyrics, and countless droning voices. Imagine if John Lennon is still alive... and created a teenage love album.

## Alex Turner - Submarine (2011)

I am sure I am not the only one to believe that Alex Turner is one of the most misunderstood modern musicians. People think that he is adored by millions of women just because he is handsome, and perhaps listening to Arctic Monkeys is considered hip amongst women nowadays?

Beyond his charming act, though, you should listen to this album to understand why everything he wrote and sang is _actually_ spectacular. This album is made for the movie [Submarine](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1440292/). Therefore, it has a complete setlist to listen to when you fall in love, enjoy your first date, are stuck on an enigma, and ultimately break up.

## The Beatles - Revolver (1966)

Decades after their last studio album was released, The Beatles still has a large following and is definitely the most significant influencer of today's pop and rock bands. Die-hard [Beatlemania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatlemania) (yes, it has its own Wikipedia page) will always tell you that Sgt. Pepper's is their _magnum opus_; their most outstanding work. I beg to differ. Revolver is a more refreshing album to solemnly listen on repeat for me.

Anyway, if you dislike The Beatles, there is definitely something wrong with your taste. Or probably your life in general.
