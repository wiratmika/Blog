This is the story of how I organized a seemingly impossible and highly ambitious event, [Startup Academy](http://web.archive.org/web/20151110034935/http://compfest.web.id/event/startup-academy) [CompFest7](//id.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompFest). An event of this scale, organized by Indonesian university students, is never held before. This writing is long overdue because of my laziness, so here goes.

## How It Began

During one fine evening of October 4th, 2014, while having a chit-chat with one of my best friends in the car on the way to Pondok Indah Mall, we half-jokingly talk about what if I take command of academies in [CompFest](https://compfest.web.id), an annual IT event held by students of Faculty of Computer Science Universitas Indonesia. Back then, it was a division whose work including [OrganizeIT](https://app.compfest.web.id/event/grandlaunching), Animaton Academy, and co-organizing the seminars of CompFest competitions. Of course I did not take that talk seriously, because more or less it was a drunk talk.

Time passed, until it is my cohort's turn to become the core organizers of CompFest. It has long been my dream to actually [make a dent in the universe](http://www.macworld.com/article/1162827/steve_jobs_making_a_dent_in_the_universe.html), so back then I said, fuck it, I will just enlist because I have nothing much to lose, right? After considering many things, I joined the team as the initiator and person in charge of Startup Academy, taking with me a huge naiveté. All knowing very well that I might lost considerable amount of time and especially sleep without getting paid at all, as do all of my colleagues. It turned out that I somehow jumped into a shark pool, figuratively. A *nasty* shark pool.

After the whole team had been assembled, I began conceptualize this dream. I interviewed several seniors who are well-known to be active on startup scene. I made endless researches and incorporated ideas from several other startup events and seminars, such as [Lean Startup Machine](https://www.leanstartupmachine.com/) and [gDayX & DevFest Indonesia](https://sites.google.com/a/kibar.co.id/gdayx-devfest-indonesia/program/jakarta). It is basically an abomination of those events, simply because all I have is assumptions on how this event should be; I do not actually know what is the best way to do it. I just take the plunge because - yes this sounds cliché - the only way to know is to try.

To give you a glimpse of the dreams that I am trying to sell, here is an excerpt of the external proposal that I wrote myself:

> In order to keep up with such pace of advancement, CompFest, with its core competence in information technology, presents an event named Startup Academy. CompFest7 - Startup Academy will collaborate with experts on Indonesian startup scene to educate people with human resources potential and ideas in order to solve problems in Indonesia with concrete solutions. CompFest7 - Startup Academy is expected to nurture people that one day will make impacts for Indonesia and contribute to Indonesia’s creative economy.

> CompFest7 - Startup Academy is a part of event series held by CompFest7 which is focused on the development of technology startups in Indonesia. Participants will receive relevant education in startup development, such as talks by industry leaders, feedbacks from mentors, earn networking chances, and receive insights from those who are already battle-tested in real world. Physical meetups will be held twice with a duration of 2 days each. The format will be a blend of workshop, fireside chat, and mentoring.

I am utterly amazed by how talented I am at creating such dreamy marketing materials back then.

## How It Came to Fruition

The whole preparation phase was kind of awful. I did not pass the first bidding for the committee position because the panel somewhat could not grasp what I am trying to achieve (and to be honest, neither can I). After we finally get going, most of our emails were replied with rejection; a few were point blank and the rest of them after prolonged negotiations. Some of them never even send a reply.

Coordinating with the supporting divisions of CompFest is really hard, because they have to do shit tons of job without - you guess it - being paid, just like me. One of the speakers actually got sick and admitted to the hospital (he even sent a photo of his arm being transfused) just *three days* before the D-day. We frantically searched for replacement, and with the help from the aforementioned speaker, we managed to secure a new one, without even meeting him in person. And all of those are only the ones that I can still clearly remember today: there are still many, many nags that haunt my sleep for that whole year.

Ultimately, with the help of my colleague [Hasandi Patriawan](http://patriawans.com), we managed to invite several startup-ish people to participate in our event, ten of them to be exact. The names include [Traveloka co-founder and head of design](http://www.bintang.com/success/read/2849381/albert-zhang-berhenti-bekerja-demi-membangun-traveloka), [prominent venture capitalist](https://id.linkedin.com/in/dondihananto), [Bukalapak co-founder and CFO](https://id.linkedin.com/in/fajrinrasyid), [Tokopedia early employee](https://id.linkedin.com/in/trinugraha), and [Developer Mengajar initiator](https://id.linkedin.com/in/sidiqpermana).

*I mean, just look at the density of that poster...*

One thing I am still grateful of is that all of the mentors and speakers are contributing to the event without any kind of monetary compensation. One of the best bunches of them is [Mr. Andrias Ekoyuono](https://id.linkedin.com/in/andrias98), arguably one of the nicest man I have ever met. I contacted [Ideosource](http://ideosource.com/), a venture capital that he once led, and he replied to us personally. After we meet directly, he is willing to help us and gave some really major insights on how Startup Academy should be held. He is also willing to be both the event’s mentor and advisor for us. God bless him.

No matter how arduous they were, the event actually took off and you can see the quick recap [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20151110035701/http://blog.compfest.web.id/meetup-i-startup-academy-gagal-itu-wajar/) and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20151110035851/http://blog.compfest.web.id/meetup-ii-startup-academy/).

## How It Ends

To sum it up, it feels very dreadful (I cannot sleep without thinking about it at least a few times a week) and rewarding experience at the same time.

![It's a wrap](/assets/images/its-a-wrap.png)  
*It's a wrap! My team indeed requires profanity education.*

After the shitstorm was finally over, I realized I barely made the event a successful one (relative to my expectations); but after everything was said and done, I got to learn and earn countless intagible things. I met with a lot of people and found some really good friends from the committee. Obviously we already knew each other before the event, but we actually got closer after we had fun laughing at each other's agony and unluckiness. Indeed, I believe that understanding one's fears and humor taste is the best way to be acquainted with someone.

> I did not achieve what I originally strived for. But I earned something much more.

I had to jumpstart my way on learning what it takes to build a proper startup (which actually made me lazy to start my own). I learned how to manage a team, and most important of all, what my weaknesses are in terms of organizing them.

Not everything was on the bright side though. My dad passed away due to chronic hepatitis B complication before the event was held. This was supposed to be one of my ultimate presents for him, who were once an entrepreneur himself. Among some of my regrets, I never told him about this event because I thought it would be cool if I just surprised him with an article on the media (although, it turns out, no media explicitly mentioned my name, let alone showed my face).

Amongst many reasons, I broke up with my girlfriend because of some disagreements that we could not work out. I guess it is a lesson for me to find a couple who is more resilient to living with someone with such enterprising life.

Do I regret any of those moments? Absolutely not. Life is all about connecting the dots, and I am pretty sure that a thing or two that I get from running Startup Academy will be used in the later part of my life. I can only wait to see what the future might hold.
