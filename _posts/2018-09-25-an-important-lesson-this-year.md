In politic, relationship, and career, I learn one very important commonality.

There will always be differing opinions. Some of them will contradict one another. If that happens, there is a very great chance that someone is lying. Everyone has an agenda.

You have to know which one is which. The problem is, it will not be obvious at first.

It is very to easy dismiss the fact that even friends that you trust with your heart can easily betray you.
