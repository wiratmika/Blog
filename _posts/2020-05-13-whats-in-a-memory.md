Or to be more precise, does our memory comprised of perceptions that we sense during its creation? That was a question I asked myself after repeatedly realized that how I perceive a certain music can be significanly influenced by moments or people, conscious or not.

Let's say that you discovered a really good song. In the honeymoon period, someone that you love passed away. That song will always be fun to hear, but as time goes by, it becomes more sorrow as it reminds you of someone you once hold dearly. I felt it personally because a song I used to hear so many times when my dad passed away can still bring me tears whenever I listen to it, even though the song is supposed to be an upbeat one.

Apparently, the same concept applies to other senses such scent. I might barely remember a person I used to know well if I don't talk to them for a long time, but if I smell their fragrances, I can instantly recall their figures and memorable moments that we've wrote together.

Our brain is attaching senses recollection to memories, perhaps even augmented by them. It is perhaps the ultimate biological manifestation of the parable: "The film and the people might be expired, but the stories will stay eternal."
