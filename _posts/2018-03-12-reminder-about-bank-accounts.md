I've just closed one of my conventional bank accounts that I have never used anymore.

With the advent of digital banking, I see no point of me and you paying exorbitant fees for outdated services and receiving practically negative interest.

If you're living in or near Jakarta, I strongly urge you to consider the same. Without us realizing it, unused savings accounts are becoming liabilities.

Anyway, the account might be closed, but buying their stocks is of course should keep going. ðŸ˜‰
