I do clearly remember the nights when we were sharing our gibberish rants about what went wrong with this life and how our grandiose plans would change it. The dreams we had as a young, na√Øve teenagers seemed so apparent and satisfying at that time, no matter how illucid.

Yet it is just sad to realize that what was left of them was only memories of years that had already gone by. We were set apart by fate, grudgingly acknowledging that we will probably never meet again. I am not even sure whether you are still the same person that we once was.

Hell, I am not ranting, because this is bound to repeat anyway. You are the things that already happened, a blueprint that will manifest itself again and again. That is why I hate time, so much.

If only.
