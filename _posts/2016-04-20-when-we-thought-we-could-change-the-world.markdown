I do clearly remember the nights when we were sharing our gibberish rants about what went wrong with this world and how our grandiose plans can change it. The fantasies we had as a young dreamers seemed so apparent and satisfying at the time, no matter how illucid.

It is just sad to realize that what was left of them was only memories of years that had already gone by. We were set apart by fate, grudgingly acknowledging that we will probably never meet again. Hell, even if we ever crossed path again, I am not sure whether we are still the same person that we once was.

What can I say? This is bound to repeat anyway. You are the very things that we talked about back then, a blueprint that will manifests itself again and again. If only I could turn back the clock, I guess everything would be the same anyway.

Whatever it is that you found at the end of the bridge, I hope it truly is what you are seeking for.
