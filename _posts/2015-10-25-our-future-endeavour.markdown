When I was in high school, I wrote two short prose for my father's birthday, which made my mother jealous. As the time goes by and I got drown in college life, I did not continue that habit. Lately, I realized that a man's memory capabilities are severely limited and writing is the best form of archival - at least for me - and therefore, I would like to tell a little story about my father, for once more.

My father do not reflect the stereotype of a Javanese father at all. He is very insensitive and does not have a sentimental or melancholic feeling, and, even though he actually does, he rarely shows them, even to his family. Everything that my father said is based on objective judgments, which can be cold-hearted at times. His enticement for naughty and generally bad jokes do not make it any better either. And yet, if you had a chance to have a conversation with my father, you will not see those traits at all and only see him as a random old man you met at the supermarket with an expansive life experiences.

I am not trying to brag, but the way he re-enact his experiences, seeing things from a weird point of view, teaching and lecturing me, are the primary reasons that made my way of thinking more independent than my peers. It made me more resilient to ideas that are irrational or implausible. It also, however, created countless disagreements I have with my father. As I grew older and more mature, I began to reject many of my father's questionable values that I once blindly accept. But in all case, my father is - and always will be - supportive with any decisions that I made.

Since I was in primary school, my father always encourage my older brother and I to chase our dreams, whatever they might be. My brother aspires to be a movie director, an uncommon profession with uncertain life and absolutely no assurance. My mother used to questions - and even objects - that desire, and, well, my father fully supports my brother's passion. Even further, my father spent many of his times studying relevant informations of our passions; mostly subjects concerning business, my father's speciality. He did those things so that he can guides my brother and I in the midst of our daily life: when we are having a trip together in a car, when we are having a dinner, and when we are having a conversation regarding the future or a big decision we have to make.

As a side note, thanks to my father, I have an uncommon taste for music; I had (unintentionally) listened to *Strawberry Fields Forever* and *Wish You Were Here* since longer than I can remember.

It is a common thing for retired people to enjoy their life, dedicating their time for other-worldly matters, or simply wasting time and money just for the sake of it. Apparently, that is only partially true for my father. As of this writing, my father already hits the age 60 mark. In his seemingly laid-back life, he still insists on doing businesses or projects that I still do not fully understand what he is actually doing, even until now.

And that spirit of doing things while ignoring his age is what inspires me to keep learning, doing useful things, and make use of time frugally. I spent majority my childhood and teenage for leisure, and I somehow regret it. My wake-up call was, when I graduated from high school, I am not accepted in any public universities; it was a truly hard blow for me. Yet, not even a single time my father bashed me for my laziness nor for my failure. I am not satisfied studying in private university, and I asked my parents for permission to take a break from college, join in a preparatory course, and trying my luck in the national university admission test once more. Obviously, my father allowed me to do so without much hesitation. But still, as a backup, without my acknowledgement, my father looked for another private university, just in case I failed again. His way of showing his care might be harsh, but pragmatic.

This is not the end of the story. I promised to myself and my parents that I will definitely make them proud of me. And my father will continue his work until his health do not permit anymore.

Our future endeavours had begun, and they definitely will be a long and winding journey. I believe we are in this together; voyaging to reach the end of this seemingly boundless passage. They will be worth it in the end, don't you think?
