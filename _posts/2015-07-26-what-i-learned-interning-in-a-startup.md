During my first internship tenure, I learned a few things that I believe are applicable in any software or technology startup.

1. The first and foremost: version control, especially Git, is handy and is used for practically all software development. Things such as line-by-line comparison, stash, and merge tools, are so helpful I almost cannot believe I have never used them before in my life. Learn version control and try to use it, at least for your personal projects.
2. For me, nothing can beat the excitement of seeing your code goes live on an actual product being used by real people. It is an opportunity that might not always be available in larger companies for entry-level jobs.
3. A text editor's simplicity might be all you need in some settings, especially in small to medium projects, rather than using full-blown IDE. Try to learn a good text editor, customize it with extensions, and memorize all of its shortcuts. I highly recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
4. Working in a tiny startup means that you are expected to be a jack of all trades. For example, if you are tasked to be a back-end developer, you are likely to be expected to do some front-end or DevOps work as well.
5. This is already obvious to most people: undocumented, messy codes are arduous to read and work upon. You either have to write clean and self-explanatory code or make up the deficiencies by writing easy-to-understand documentation. Do not neglect both at the same time unless you're highly confident that no one else will have to read your code.
6. If you work in an office with many foreigners, expect the air conditioning to be set at icy.
7. Expatriates do indeed download pirated stuff from BitTorrent... But this was the day before online streaming was the norm.
