Being an advocate of rather-frugal living and financial independence (regardless of one's job or career path), many of my friends had been asking me a thing or two regarding personal finances. From the most common question like what is the best investment they should buy to whether the whole banking world is built upon [one giant sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury).

Oftentimes, I'm using the default answer used by practically every financial advisors: it depends®. Whatever people may say, there's no single correct answer that can be readily applied to everyone, because each person's life and financial circumstances wildly differ.

With that said, rather than creating a catch-all guide which may or may not be relatable for you, I decided to tell everything about mine instead. From the foundational mindset that I hold dear to tools and investment vehicles that I actually use, including what my rationale are behind those decisions.

I'm not in any way rich (although I'm hoping to get there soon!) nor claiming myself to be a so-called _financial guru_. However, I believe useful knowledge is something that can flourish when it is openly shared, discussed, and dissected, so feel free to disagree if you choose to do so. One thing's for sure that separates me from all those charlatans out there: I have absolutely nothing to sell to you. At least not right now.

Due to the complex nature of the topic, I'm separating the discourse into 3 separate, inter-connected posts:

1. My personal philosophies and values; foundations for all my decisions and reasonings to rest upon
2. How I allocate my money, including the detailed system and tools that I use
3. Investment portfolio and specific assets that I own with regards to my goals and circumstances

# Principles and Mindsets

It is inadequate to talk about money without first talking about the principles and mindsets that we use in operating our daily life. As cliché as it might already sounds, money is not the only factor that can determine your happiness in life; but it indeed does play a huge role. That's why people prefer to cry in a Ferrari rather than a bike.

My guiding philosophies can be boiled down as follows.

## Money will not make you happy, but it can remove most of your unhappiness

Human brain is awesome and somewhat dangerous at the same time. We're able to adapt to even the most extreme conditions, allowing us to survive and evolve for thousands of years to where we are today. However, some basic neurological limitations still exist and they're not suitable for the modern world we now live in.

One of those shortcomings is something called [hedonic adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill). Shortly put, it is an adaptation mechanism in our brain where any external stimuli—such as the purchase of fancy new gadgets—will bring joy at the beginning but will gradually normalize into something that we take for granted. The more I learn about it, the more I found it to be true: things that were rare or luxurious for me at the ye olde days had now become a daily existence that I expect to be always there. Like it or not, you can't deny that it also happens to you as well at some point.

Knowing that limitation, if you're always craving for those initial excitements, your expectations will always increase and introduce you to [lifestyle creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_creep). This is probably the number one reason why most people never become rich in their life even if they have subtantial income: because their expenses always keep up with their income, hence their savings never really increase. No savings equals no wealth; no bueno.

Even worse, some people are _taking debt_ to be able to keep up with their own lifestyle demand. Productive debt such as mortgage and student loans (to some extent) are reasonable when calculated and taken carefully, but any other consumptive debt are simply the number one wealth destroyer and we should [avoid them like a plague](https://twitter.com/wiratmika/status/1410458417504784384).

In order to curb that tendency, I'm trying my best to wire my brain the other way around: rather than trying to find happiness by making the next purchase of things that I probably won't enjoy that much in the next few months, I'm thinking of money as something that can be used to _eliminate my unhappiness_ instead.

Your faucet keeps leaking? Just replace it with a better, more robust one. Binge-watching a lot and your current internet speed cannot keep up with the buffering? Cool, just upgrade your bandwidth. Having a back pain due to sitting too much in your home office? An electric standing desk and walking pad are in order. Doesn't like your job or hate your boss? Just quit it, you got a safety net that can support your livelihood.

Happiness is difficult to quantify and certainly have different meanings for each of us. On the other hand, our material unhappiness is mostly universal and probably doesn't take that much financial power to resolve. After you've eliminated most, if not all the things that make you unhappy, chasing _real_ happiness will become much easier because there's nothing that can hinder you in pursuing your own real source of fulfilment and satisfaction.

Happiness is a very nuanced concept to fully grasp and perhaps require a deeper discussion than my simple writing can afford. But one thing that I believe in is that **we don't need to be broke to achieve them**.

## Simplicity should be the default choice

I am heavily inspired by the book The Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins. As you can infer from its title, the road to a lifetime of wealth (and happiness) is, and should be, simple to do, for everyone, without excuses.

Our brainpower and time are limited. Some things that people think can make us rich, such as trading stocks, are much harder than it sounds and will take considerable time commitment and due dilligence. Tinkering with stocks and cryptocurrencies without those necessary preparations, at least for me, is not that much different than literal gambling.

Now don't get me wrong: I believe that stocks is the world's greatest wealth building tool. I also believe that cryptocurrency—sooner or later—have a place in this world that can potentially revolutionize the way we store and transfer wealth. But trading, and especially _timing_ when to buy or sell non-tangible assets, is a whole another world. I'll explain why I'm not going to touch it ever, unless I'm doing it for fun.

Even for people with adequate knowledge of finances, they're trying to compensate for that perceived lack of challenge by unnecessarily overcomplexing their investment vehicles. They prefer to invest in 5 different asset class where 3 of them are consisted of 5 different mutual funds. The truth is, not only it's harder to manage, but without careful consideration, it actually gives you worse result because of the fees and costs involved.

All in all, the things that are supposed to make us wealthier must not be complex, because (a) complexity takes a lot of time (and remember that time equals money) in order to make it work and (b) it doesn't yield better results.

I prefer the simplest methods, so I can spend the rest of my time doing things that I really like and enjoy. You should too.

## Maximize value and utilization, but never to the point of being stingy

Some people like to associate frugality with stinginess. To some extent, they are not wrong: I've seen a lot of people holding on to their cash like tomorrow's doomsday.

However, frugality and stinginess are two completely different mindsets. In my dictionary, frugality means maximizing value out of all spending, while stinginess means _avoiding_ all of those spending if at all possible, even for those that are important or long-term in nature, whose values can't be seen instantly.

The irony is that although the joy of hoarding cash and see it grow is real, technically speaking, **money does not give you any value until you have spent it**. That's why at the end of the day, you have to carefully pick on how you spend it: on things that can make you _less unhappy_, as I mentioned before.

For me, and I believe for the vast majority of us, the best way to spend money is to _spend it for others_. Gifts, charities, and eating out with friends are some of the things that I would never think twice when deciding to spend my money for. They give me the highest happiness ROI per dollar spent.

In any case, there's no reason for us to be stingy, even if we're trying to be more frugal than most people.

In the next part, I'll talk in more detail about how I implement my principles into action. I'll talk about my cashflow tracking, bank accounts, credit cards, and emergency funds, before getting into my investment portfolio.
