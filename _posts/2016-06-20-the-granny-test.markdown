I am proposing a simple yet nearly unattainable test for every so-called UX designer of product type. I named it _The Granny Test_.

The rules are simple: Ask elderly people who never operated a computer on a daily basis to figure out how to use your damn product. If they understand how to use it _without_ requiring their children (or anybody else) to teach them, your product passed the test.

Trust me, it is much, much harder than it sounds.
