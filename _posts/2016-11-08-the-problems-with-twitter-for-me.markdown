Once upon a time, Twitter is *the shit*. Now, I can hardly recall tens of my friends who are still actively using it on a daily basis. Most of them flocked to Snapchat, Instagram, Path (*eww*) or even LINE. Some still faithfully stayed on Facebook.

There are 2 problems that, for most of the parts, made me remove Twitter app from my phone and logout from browsers.

The first one is because none my close friends are actively using it anymore. I am not sure why this is the case, but probably because there are other, sexier social media for them to use. Or it has to be because one other reason I am about to mention: digital noise.

Digital noise is the most glaring problem that plagued Twitter in my view; there is simply too much irrelevant informations to digest. We tend to follow too many official accounts that, at first, might seem relevant to us. But instead, they are entities representatives that are paid to post informations that we just skimped and made us lose touch with people we actually want to read their tweets about.

I am using social media most likely because I want to, well, *socialize* with my friends, not because I want to be constantly fed with things that uninteresting contents, for what it is worth. *Kultwit* is probably the worst offender of them all: if your content is interesting or useful enough, please post it on a proper website, not on a series of  tweets that are actually much harder to read.

So how can Twitter fix those problems? I am not certain, because people tendencies (especially younger adults) tend to quickly change with trends. I used Instagram way back in 2012, at the time where people will most likely refer "smartphones" to touchscreen pre-BB 10 BlackBerries. Back then, I even literally deleted my accounts because I cannot found good use for it.

Look how everything changed today. When smartphone become much more commonplace and some had good cameras to go with it, Instagram really took off. Going to hyped-up places to post a really nice shot to Instagram and just forget about it has become a new norm. Heck, now even a child of 6-years old from middle-class use Instagram daily. It is sometimes scary for me to contemplate about it.

I am now once again using Instagram, because seeing silly or expensive-looking pictures of my friends or blatant reposts from lowly accounts are just plain easier for my mind to digest; which is social media is all about.

Let's not forget, though, Snapchat, a seemingly-weird ephemeral social media that "older people will never understand", quickly take over as the most prominent way for youngsters to share and brag about their daily life.

Looking back, I realize that Twitter can actually serve both purposes: you can post images and whine daily without being stigmatized as a narcissist. But you can see that it is not focused enough as a social media.

Maybe, if one day Twitter can streamline its official accounts and brand experience like the way LINE does, Twitter's content will become relevant again. No one is sure about when that will happen, though.
