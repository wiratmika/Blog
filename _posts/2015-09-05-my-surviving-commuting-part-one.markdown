No doubt commuting is an utterly repetitive and boring part of our life, but it becomes more bearable with good tunes to accompany you through the endless traffic jam or smelly armpits in metro. Here is the first part a non-exhaustive list of good albums I listen countless times during my commute, in no particular order.

## Tigapagi - Roekmana's Repertoire (2013)

The very definition of perfect Indonesian folk pop album, Roekmana's Repertoire combines the familiar Sundanese pentatonic scale, haunting melodies, and beautiful orchestration that will drown you and take you to the skies at the same time. I was amazed when I opened the packaging because it was... well... so gorgeous. It is kind of saddening for me to know it is sold only at Rp 30k-ish, I believe the artists deserve more.

## Sean Lennon - Friendly Fire (2006)

This is the album I wish I can make if I ~~have musical talents~~ took formal and expensive musical training when I was younger. Unsually melancholic chords, enchanting lyrics, and countless droning voices, Sean will make you believe John Lennon is still alive and created a teenage love album with Yoko Ono.

## Alex Turner - Submarine (2011)

I am pretty sure I am not the only one to believe that Alex Turner is one of the most misunderstood modern musician. People thought that he is adored by millions of women just because he is handsome and, I don't know, some Arctic Monkeys songs sounds nice for women?

Beyond his charming act, though, you should listen to this album to understand why everything he wrote and sing is *actually* spectacular. Since this album is closely tied to the movie [Submarine](//www.imdb.com/title/tt1440292/) (all songs are played in the movie), it has complete setlist to listen when you fell in love, enjoying your first date, stuck on an enigma, and ultimately, broke up.

## The Beatles - Revolver (1966)

So who on earth dislike The Beatles? WHO? Indeed people have different tastes in music, but you cannot deny that decades after their last studio albums was released, The Beatles still has a large following and definitely the greatest influencer of today's greatest pop and rock bands. Die-hard [Beatlemania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatlemania) (yes it has its own Wikipedia page) will always tell you that Sgt. Pepper's is their *magnum opus*; their greatest work. I beg to differ. Revolver is a more refreshing album to solemnly listen on repeat for me.

Anyway, if you dislike The Beatles, there is definitely something wrong with your taste. Or probably your life in general.
