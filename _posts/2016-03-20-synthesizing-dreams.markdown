I wrote this sometime around 2013 to enroll in a certain "technology and design" university in Singapore. I _cannot_ believe I wrote such a _beautiful_ prose in such young age. I am putting this here for archival's sake.

## Human. Art. Technology

My birth name is Wiratmika and I am an Indonesian high-school graduate. I was born in October 1994 in Jakarta, a huge multicultural and multiethnic metro, the capital of Indonesia. A place to make a living for over 10 million multiethnic and multicultural residents. I enjoy reading non-fiction books and science-related novels, light cycling, and tinkering with anything that either can be assembled or related to computer.

I am passionately fascinated by aerospace, computer, and information technology since I was a child. I still fondly remember the first time my father taught me how to operate a computer in the earliest time of my life; I was about 4 years old back then. He taught me how to change the screensaver of Windows. It is an negligible thing, but later on I realize it was the first step to help paving my way for what my devotion in life will be.

I appreciate simple, functional and pragmatic designs for everything that interacts with human. For me, human interface is an art of how to create seamless integration between human and machines. I believe that human, technology and art are three elements that are essential in the development of a better human live. Innovations, especially in information technology, will always lead to the development of other better, newer inventions.

There are many people who inspire me, mainly scientist and computer engineers who "stay up all night disassembling the world so that they can put it back together with new features." Jonas Salk and Nikola Tesla worked hard for their invention but they never aimed for profit. Alan Turing and Steve Wozniak played a big role in the world of modern computing, and yet their names are not well-known.

## Superdad & Supermom

I thank God for He blessed me with the most stupendous family I can ever imagine. My father is a daring man retired as a businessman. He has 4 sisters and 3 brothers; therefore his parents can only gave him few resources, if any, when he was young. Yet, my father courageously managed to struggle against the fate; he somehow managed to earn his MBA degree in University of Santo Tomas in Manila, Philippines. His most terrific achievement is when he was appointed as Honorary Consul of the Philippine Consulate in Indonesian Borneo in 1986. Afterwards, he started businesses ranging from eel to timber trade before finally settled in a book publishing.

What I will remember hopefully forever in my life is how my father told and taught me and my older brother not to aim for mere job, money and such boring things. We are told to do what we really love and ultimately realize our dreams, whatever it is. He admonish me not to be afraid to do risky actions, because nothing wonderful can be done without taking uncertain steps. All it takes is guts and goals.

My mother is a stewardess for the state-owned airline of Indonesia. Thanks to her benefits as a senior employee, I can go to many places for heavily discounted fare; often for free. Those chances opened my windows and gave me a broader view of the world. I began to realize how big our world is. Every country that I had visited has their own unique inhabitants and cultures that differs them from the others. Even though Indonesia is a huge country on its own, it only plays small role in the global culture.

With my mother's random and often hectic flying schedules, she still managed to take care of my family the way a regular housewife does. She taught me many things about life and how I should live it. She always gives me support no matter how messed up I am. Hence, I am related closer to my mother inwardly.

## Life

In June 2009 I enrolled in SMA Taruna Nusantara a high school located in Magelang, Central Java, Indonesia. It was one of the most life changing experiences I ever had in my life. The school gave me the privilege to live with 304 students from literally all over Indonesia, and now I can proudly call it the best high school in Indonesia.

Taruna Nusantara is a military-like boarding school that has the perfect blend of academic, physical, personalities, national values and leadership training. Those so-called 'special curricula' are taught not only in words but also in actions. The concept was so original and unique that it became the role model for many newer high schools in Indonesia.

I joined the computer team of my school, which consists of only 7 members in my batch out of about 60 interested applicants. I won National Science Olympiad up to provincial level, a feat I never thought I could have done it before. In the 2010 mid-year break, I went to Melbourne for overseas homestay and English program. It was truly an exhilarating trip. For the first time in my life I lived far away from my parents, wandering around the magnificent (for me) city of the Down Under. I like Australian's lifestyle and people, and I don't have any hard times adapting myself to my host family.

In the end, the most valuable lesson I had learned from my school was social relationship is the key to a truly happy and successful life. Since our relations are somewhat militaristic bond, we suffer together and we enjoy our happiness together. In certain times, friendship is above all; we clearly have to prioritize it rather than listening to our own ego. Life is wildly unpredictable, and friendship might eventually saves our life in various unexpected situations. Overall, it is indescribable in words.

I hope that in the future I can collaborate with visionary, hardworking yet fun people to create a better technology for a better world.
