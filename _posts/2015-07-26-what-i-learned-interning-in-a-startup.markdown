Place I had worked in might not be glamorous and I am pretty sure you never heard of it, but here is a few things that I believe will apply in any of software or technology startup:

1. The first and foremost: version control, especially Git, is extremely useful and is used practically everywhere. Things such as line-by-line comparison, stash, and merge tool, are immensely helpful I almost cannot believe I never used them before in my life. Learn version control and try to actually use it at least for your own projects.
2. For me, nothing can beat the excitements of seeing your code goes live on a real product, being used by real people. It is something that is rare on a medium to large scale enterprises.
3. Just like academic settings, for small to medium projects, text editor's simplicity and functionality trumps IDE anytime. Learn a good text editor, stick with it, customize it with plugins, and memorize all of its shortcuts. Trust me, it will pay off in the long run. I do highly recommend [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a starter.
4. Unless you are a hard learner, you do better not apply to work in a place where they are using languages that are either:
    - You rarely use
    - You tried and instantly dislike
    - You never use at all
5. I am not sure about this one, but it seems that working in a startup means that you are expected to be a jack of all trades. Say, just because you are tasked to be a backend developer does not mean you are not expected to do some frontend or system administration work.
6. Undocumented, messy codes are hell. Seriously, documentation is important as fuck, and if you are not extremely certain that no one else will have to read your code, **do not** dare to neglect it.
7. If you are working in a place with many foreigners, expect the climate control to be ridiculously cold.
8. Expatriates do indeed use BitTorrent and download pirated stuffs...
