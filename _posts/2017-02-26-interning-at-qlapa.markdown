_This post bears the same thread as my previous writing, [What I Learned Interning in a Startup](/2015/07/26/what-i-learned-interning-in-a-startup.html)._

So basically I've interned twice in Indonesian tech companies, in which one of them is [really small](https://www.trustklik.com/) and of them is [really huge](https://www.traveloka.com/). Both places has its own merits and characteristics, and I did not regret worked for either.

Yet it was not enough for me. I was looking for more opportunities, more challenges, and more insights for my ever-changing outlook of what I am going to do after graduation, which is nearing soon at the time of this writing. I was eager for a place small enough so that I can make a proper presence and large enough so that I can learn real best engineering practices.

One fine day during my last summer internship, I was emailed by a spokeperson of [Qlapa](https://qlapa.com/), a curated handicraft marketplace startup. The timing couldn't be better. My good friend Tri Ahmad Irfan (also known as [the][] [boy][] [who][] [interned][] [at][] [Twitter][]) once told me that Qlapa is amongst promising startups in Indonesia since they have a really solid set of founders who knows their shit and managed to capitalize their market well.

I thought, what the hell, I've got nothing to lose anyway, so I decided to give it a try and pay their office a visit. To my surprise, what I thought was going to be a friendly afternoon chit-chat with tea turns out to be a full-blown engineering interview. I practically prepared for nothing and simply went on with the flow. One noteful thing though is that at the end of the interview (by the [CTO](https://id.linkedin.com/in/fransiskusx) and some of the engineering crews) I get to speak with the [CEO of the company](https://id.linkedin.com/in/bennyfajarai) himself. I mean, how many times you actually get to speak with the CEO of the company you're applying to?

They succesfully convinced me that indeed Qlapa might the place I'm looking for. Their answer to my favorite question of "what do you see of your company in 5 years" is reasonably ambitious. So I came for the second interview - basically the continuation of the first one - and I received an internship offer for my one-month winter break. Since it's the only offer I have and I'm not really looking for alternatives, I gladly accepted their offer. Productive holiday is never a bad thing anyway, right?

Boy, it was probably one of the best decisions I had ever made.

The first day that I came to work was a pleasantly usual day; it took me roughly one hour to get from home to office. I arrived at around 9:30, and it was funny that no one was in the room except for two other engineering interns who happened to be from the same faculty as I am. During that first day alone, the electricity went out for 1 hour and we got some free pizzas and martabaks.

After the new year eve, another few interns joined in. Since that day, my days of _enjoying go to work_, for the first time in my life, began.

The work was more on the fun side. Qlapa mainly used Play (Java version) as its backend framework. I had used several Java and PHP frameworks, and for me, by far, Play make the most sensible middle ground in terms of both ease of use and feature set. The domains of work that I had to do forced me to learn so many new, interesting things; hell, I even wrangled with a production-grade React app with reducer.

The best part of them all is - you might have guessed it - the environment. Qlapa is a young startup established and nurtured by young people. The oldest person to work there is about the same age of my older brother, which is about 5 years older than me. We never address anyone by their title there: we simply call them by nicknames. One day I even jokingly shouted the first name of our CEO loudly even though he is just a few chairs from me.

Those relatively small age differences does matter: I can get acquainted with anybody easily since there is absolutely no generation gap whatsoever. Everything that we talk or joke about simply clicked, without having to resort to awkward small talks that we usually make when interacting with older people. Our CTO also encourage everyone on the development team to reach out directly to other teams if we have any inquiries regarding the problems we have to solve or the solutions we want to build. The physical layout and size of the office allow us to do this, and in fact, makes it pretty enjoyable. This is another form of how we can mingle with each other daily.

There are 7 interns in the development team (which includes all engineers/designers/product managers), and it happens that all of them are my friends from the same faculty, albeit cross-year. It feels like an icing on the cake, since that makes us already on a single frequency and our communication simply worked from day one. We are very hedonistic bunches too, in which we ordered GO-FOOD so many, many times. The most memorable thing I can recall is that we ordered [KOI Cafe](https://www.zomato.com/id/jakarta/koi-cafe-penjaringan/menu) drinks 5 times and [legendary](http://citizen6.liputan6.com/read/2587923/penggila-mie-dunia-kapok-makan-mie-di-warung-indonesia-kenapa) [Abang Adek](https://www.zomato.com/id/jakarta/abang-adek-tomang/menu) 3 times, and countless snacks from local Alfamart. Looking back, it almost feels like I'm actually losing money rather than earned it after working there. Jokes aside, I can assure you that software engineer intern salary in Qlapa is competitive (hint: it's _more_ than the salary of two of the biggest e-commerce marketplaces in Indonesia).

My time in Qlapa was a jolly good one that it feels better than spending my holiday doing nothing. After my tenure had ended, it makes me kind of sad and wishes that I can work for a longer time. Although it might sound somewhat obvious, working at Qlapa is more enjoyable than continuing my study.

My take is, if you're passionate about learning and building meaningful product in a seriously fun environment, or you want to have great chances to make an lasting impact through your thinking and decision-making role, go ahead and give Qlapa a try. If you're not convinced yet, I think the founders are generous enough to talk with you if you need more persuasion. By the way, this is not a sponsored post. I just happen to like them so much it urges me to write a memoir in the form of writing; an eternal form. As always, whatever you're going to do, good luck on your future endeavours!
