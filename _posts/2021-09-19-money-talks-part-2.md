In this part, I'll talk about how I manage my money, tools that help me to get a clear picture of my financial situation, and how I'm trying to get the most bang out of every buck.

# Cashflow Tracking

Peter Drucker is credited to saying "if you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it." Although it's usually applied in business contexts, it's also relevant for most aspects of your life as well: before being able to improve something, you have to know where you are right now.

If you want to understand where you are now financially, you'll need at least 4 information that I derive from general accounting equation:

1. Your assets: everything you own that has intrinsic value and either produce money or can be easily liquidified (i.e., sold). Any other things that you own that don't fit those criteria (e.g. cars, phones, and furnitures) should **not** count towards it.
2. Your liabilities: everything you owe, i.e. loans and debts to any parties, such as car loans, mortgages, and I-owe-yous.
3. Your income: money that goes in your pocket.
4. Your expenses: money that goes out your pocket.

I use [Banktivity](https://www.banktivity.com), an app that's only available in macOS and iOS[^1]. It has a good interface and doesn't enforce a vendor lock-in; they don't hold your data hostage when you don't want to continue your subscription. Whatever tools that you're using, I highly recommend for you to consider and use double entry bookkeeping, because it will make your tracking much easier.

[^1]: I only use the macOS version, because I spend most of my time on my computer anyway. The data is synced with my Dropbox account.

Back when I experimented with simple personal finance apps that don't have double entry bookkeeping, I have a hard time tracking a lot of things especialy when I'm transferring money between my own accounts or borrowing/lending money to others. It was all solved when I began to use tools that have the double entry built into the design. If you think that such method is only suited for business, your own finance isn't actually differ much from a company; after all, you're a small enterprise of your own, controlling a real set of cashflows.

For the tool itself, you can technically use a solution as simple as spreadsheets. But for the sake of user-friendliness and automatically-generated reports to gain insights, I prefer to use an app specifically designed for this purpose. Regardless of any tools or workflows that you're using, there's one thing that you always need to keep in mind: just like most habits, you have to be consistent in order to see the benefits.

Some people don't believe it, but I actually track every single cent going in and out of my pocket consistently since January 2019. I do know my balance sheets at any given point in time since then, and I can give you the exact numbers of income and expense for those periods as well. My inspiration to do this is [Your Money or Your Life](https://yourmoneyoryourlife.com/book-summary/) book, a good primer on how you should treat money: as a tool to trade with your time and obtain your freedom. The book suggests you to be honest with yourself and track all of your money flow so that you can see the relationship of stuffs that you buy and how many precious seconds in life that you spent to be able to afford them.

This might sounds too extreme for some, but it's easier than most people thought. Unless you have really huge amount of transactions (which is usually a sign of problem in itself), it usually won't take more than a few minutes to recapitulate and reconcile everything, and you don't have to do it everyday. You can do it weekly, although the more often you do it, the quicker it'll be.

## To budget or not to budget?

Budgeting is one the most common things people talk about when they talk about personal finances. Despite its touted benefits, I personally do not do strict budgeting myself, for two reasons:

1. It's one additional thing that I need to monitor and maintain regularly. You cannot do it half-assedly: you have to track your budget properly, or it somewhat defeats the purpose. This is not as easy to do because by its nature, our financial life can be hard to predict, so you'll have to make almost constant adjustments.
2. Since I'm already tracking my cashflow properly, I can just generate a report of how I spend for a given period and see how I can optimize it for future periods.

Rather than using a budget, I prefer to always _think through every spending I made at the time_ and track the final expenses afterwards. For something that I definitely _need_, it's usually just a matter of finding which ones that suffice my needs at the best value possible, taking into account utility and long-term durability. For other things that I _want_, usually I put them in some sort of a wishlist and take a look at them later after at least a week. If the urge to purchase them are still there, then there's a chance that it's probably worth it. Otherwise I just dump and never think about them again.

The drawback of not having a pre-determined budget is that this will require a greater self-control, because nothing stands in the way between us and our splurging. It requires us to be more mindful of all spendings that we made.

If you choose to do budgeting to gain control of your finances, I highly recommend you to check out [You Need a Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com), a popular tool to help you create, keep track, and maintain your budget. I've heard some pretty good reviews about it.

# Bank Accounts

I have two primary bank accounts: one in the most popular bank in the country that I must own to receive my payroll, and a [digital bank account](https://www.tmrwbyuob.com/id/id/mgm/friend_referral.html?ref=https%3A%2F%2Ftmrwbyuobid.page.link%3Fapn%3Dcom.uob.id.digitalbank%26ibi%3Dcom.uob.id.digitalbank%26link%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.tmrwbyuob.com%3FreferralCode%3DM01380097938) that offers absolutely zero monthly fees or any other charges, including transfer to _any_ banks, with _no limit nor any prerequisite_.

I have strong conviction that over time, branchless digital banks will the be the norm of banking going forward thanks to the cost efficiencies that they offer. Unlike traditional banks, they can save substantial operatings cost by not having to maintain physical branches.

Nowadays, I don't know a single person who _enjoys_ going to the bank, even if they're a priority customer that can skip the awfully long waiting lines. Bank's limited opening hours, which is limited to workdays when people have to attend their day job, is not helping either.

With the prevalence of smartphone and near-ubiquitous internet connection, I see few reasons why traditional banks are better, such as for legacy reasons or physical features like a safe deposit box. The only major drawback for digital banks that I can think of is that if something happens to your account, you can only rely on the bank's customer service. There's no actual branch that you can visit to yell at the manager. This is compounded by the fact that with simple social engineering, it's relatively easy to phish people to get their login credentials.

# Credit Cards

Despite what some people say about credit cards, I believe it's one of the most powerful finance tools that has almost no drawbacks when utilized properly. In my view, all of those drawbacks can also be easily mitigated.

## Why use credit cards?

There are two primary reasons why I use credit cards.

### It's just more profitable

If you're paying for anything in cash, you're almost literally leaving money on the table. Except in shady stores where there are credit card surcharges, price of most goods and services are already taking into account of fees that the merchants have to pay to banks or payment services in order to provide you with digital payment options. If you don't utilize them, **you're paying for somebody else's usage of those digital payments**.

Although some people say that e-wallets are the logical next step of payment evolution (which is already happening in some countries such as the People's Republic of China), I beg to disagee: except during their early days where VC-funded promotions are in the rage, they don't provide much benefits compared to the good old credit cards, which had been reliably existing for decades now.

E-wallets are also more cumbersome because they require you to have a mobile device with reliable internet connection and do top-ups when you want to use them. It's common to see queue lines are clogged up by people who realized they have insufficient balance and have to do a top-up on the spot.

E-wallets are also debit by nature, which means that whenever there's a fraud transaction that you don't approve or someone created an honest mistake of charging you with incorrect value, your money is gone until you ask the provider to refund it for you. This situation puts you at the mercy of your provider to process the refund. Using credit card, on the other hand, you haven't pay for anything yet when you made a transaction, hence you have a higher leverage and time to resolve any issues before you have to pay your bills.

At worst, I've experienced myself an occasion where a significant value of my top-up was not processed for _almost 3 weeks_ due to an unexplained issue on their side. The customer service was abysmal and not helpful at all during my inquiry.

### Helps you maintain your cashflow

Credit and debit card transactions provide you with electronic statements delivered via e-mail that can help you reconcile with your cashflow tracking and can serve as a future reference. In addition, because your transactions are rolled out into a single billing, it's easier to predict when you'll have to pay for your expenses. Even better, when the transactions are made near at or after the cut-off period, you don't have to pay for them until next month, which can be extremely useful sometimes.

## How to use credit cards properly

There is one golden rule that you must absolutely obey: **always pay your bills in full**. Never, ever carry a balance in your card. Treat it as if it's a debit card: use it only when you can actually afford to pay for something with cash.

If you're doing it that way, not only you can avoid interests (which as I mentioned in my previous post, is the single greatest destroyer of wealth), it also sets your notion that it's just a mere tool of payment, not a magic wand that can somehow allows you to purchase things that you cannot do otherwise.

What about annual fees? In my country, annual fees are weird: they kind of exists, but when you really dig through it, they're probably not. It's somewhat easy to request for annual fee removal through the bank's call center, and they will usually ask you to spend a relatively insignificant amount of spending to waive the fee altogether.

## Which credit cards to get

As I mentioned, merchants pay hefty fees to banks in order to be able to receive credit card payments. Thus, banks were able to pass some of those profits to customers in various forms, such as cashback and airline miles. Although the amount is somewhat negligible, then again, this is free money that you should not pass up.

I own several credit cards, but I primarily only use two: the one that's provided by my digital bank because they offer significant cashback for certain categories that's currently the best in the country, and one general-purpose card that's providing consistent airline miles for all expenses. Thanks to my minimal spending and COVID-19 pandemic at the time of this writing, unfortunately I haven't been able to utilize my earned miles yet.

My suggestion is that you should apply for the best card you can afford **with regards to your income and spending level**. Going under will lose you the potential rewards, while going higher will make it more expensive to own because of the higher level of minimum spending that you have to make in order to make you eligible for the annual fee waivers.

# Emergency Fund

After the basic in-and-outs of money are sorted, the first order of business is to have an emergency fund at hand. It's basically a rainy day money that you can use to cover your emergency expenses without needing to dig through your longer-term investments. Think of unexpected things like layoffs, unexpected medical expenses, or any other mishaps that you'll inevitably encounter in your life.

The amount itself vary depending on two things: your base monthly expenses and your personal circumstances. Your _base_ expenses is the absolute bare minimum value you need to keep you alive and well-fed: housing (rent or mortgage), food, transportation, etc. Your actual monthly expenses is usually higher, and in times of emergency, you have to be able to trim down the more frivolous spendings.

The second factor to consider is your very own life circumstances. If you're single, doesn't have dependents such as retired parents or kids, or working in a secure job, you will not need as much as those who have family to feed, living paycheck to paycheck (or even freelancing), or have any other inherent volatilities. The suggested number vary, but the rule of thumb is usually between 3 months at the very least and up to 1 year or more for those who require more safety net.

I'm keeping that stash in money market fund which is generally liquid, have small risk of losses (you don't want to put your emergency fund in something that can goes down in value just when you need it), and pays a decent amount of return. You can use time deposits as well, although most banks won't have better interest rates than the return of money market funds and can fine you for early withdrawal.

In the next part, I'll talk about what investments that I own and the reasonings behind them. I'll also share about stock and mutual fund brokers that I use and why I chose them.
