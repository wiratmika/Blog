In this part, I'll talk about how I manage my money: tools that I use to help me to get a clear picture of my financial situation and how I'm trying to get the most bang out of every buck.

# Cashflow Tracking

Peter Drucker is credited with saying "if you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it." Although it's usually applied in business contexts, it's relevant for most aspects of your life as well: before being able to improve something, we have to know where we are right now.

If we want to understand where we are now financially, we'll need at least 4 information that is used in the general accounting equation:

1. Assets: everything we own that has intrinsic value and either produce money or can be easily liquidated (i.e., sold). Any other things that we own that don't fit those criteria (e.g. cars, phones, and furniture) should **not** count towards it.
2. Liabilities: everything we owe, i.e. loans and debts to any parties, such as car loans, mortgages, and I-owe-yous.
3. Income: money that goes in our pocket.
4. Expenses: money that goes out of our pocket.

I use [Banktivity](https://www.banktivity.com), an app that's only available in macOS and iOS[^1]. It has a good interface and doesn't enforce a vendor lock-in; they don't hold your data hostage if we don't want to continue our subscription. Whatever tools that you want to use, I highly recommend you consider and use double-entry bookkeeping, because it will make the tracking much easier.

[^1]: I only use the macOS version, because I spend most of my time on my computer anyway. The data is synced with my Dropbox account.

Back when I experimented with simple personal finance apps that don't have double-entry bookkeeping, I was having a hard time tracking a lot of things especially when I'm transferring money between my own accounts or borrowing/lending money to others. It was all solved when I began to use tools that have the double-entry built into the design. If you think that such a method is only suited for business, our own finance isn't actually differed much from a company; after all, we're a small enterprise of our own, controlling a real set of cashflows.

For the tool itself, we can technically use a solution as simple as spreadsheets. But for the sake of user-friendliness and automatically-generated reports to gain insights, I prefer to use an app specifically designed for this purpose. Regardless of any tools or workflows that we're using, there's one thing that we always need to keep in mind: just like most habits, we have to be consistent to see the benefits.

Some people don't believe it, but I have actually tracked every single cent going in and out of my pocket consistently since January 2019. I do know my balance sheets at any given point in time since then, and I can give you the exact numbers of income and expenses for those time frames as well.

My inspiration to do this is from [Your Money or Your Life](https://yourmoneyoryourlife.com/book-summary/) book, a good primer on how we should treat money: as a tool to trade with our time and obtain our freedom. The book suggests we be honest with ourselves and track all of our money flow so that we can see the relationship of stuff that we buy and how many precious seconds in life that we spent to be able to afford them.

That might sound too extreme, but it's easier than most people thought. Unless you have a really huge amount of transactions (which is usually a sign of a problem in itself), it usually won't take more than a few minutes to recapitulate and reconcile everything, and we don't have to do it every day. We can do it weekly, although the more often we do it, the quicker it'll be.

## To budget or not to budget?

Budgeting is one the most common things people talk about when they talk about personal finances. Despite its touted benefits, I personally do not do strict budgeting myself, for two reasons:

1. It's one additional thing that I need to monitor and maintain regularly. We cannot do it half-assedly: we have to track our budget properly, or it somewhat defeats the purpose. This is not as easy to do because, by its nature, our financial life can be hard to predict, so we have to make almost constant adjustments along the way.
2. Since I'm already tracking my cash flow properly, I can just generate a report of how I spend for a given period and see how I can optimize it for future periods.

Rather than using a budget, I prefer to always _think through every spending I made at the time_ and track the final expenses afterward. For something that I definitely _need_, it's usually just a matter of finding which ones that suffice my needs at the best value possible, taking into account utility and long-term durability.

For other things that I _want_, usually, I put them in some sort of a wishlist and take a look at them later after at least a week. If the urge to purchase them is still there, then there's a chance that it's probably worth it. Otherwise, I just dump and never think about them again.

The drawback of not having a pre-determined budget is that this will require greater self-control because nothing stands in the way between us and our splurging. It requires us to be more mindful of all spendings that we make.

Shall you choose to do budgeting to gain control of your finances, I highly recommend you to check out [You Need a Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com), a popular tool to help us create, keep track, and maintain our budget. I've heard some pretty good reviews about it.

# Bank Accounts

I have two primary bank accounts: one in the most popular bank in the country that I must own to receive my payroll, and a [digital bank account](https://www.tmrwbyuob.com/id/id/mgm/friend_referral.html?ref=https%3A%2F%2Ftmrwbyuobid.page.link%3Fapn%3Dcom.uob.id.digitalbank%26ibi%3Dcom.uob.id.digitalbank%26link%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.tmrwbyuob.com%3FreferralCode%3DM01380097938) that offers absolutely zero monthly fees or any other charges, including transfer to _any_ banks, with _no limit nor any prerequisite_.

I have a strong conviction that over time, branchless digital banks will be the norm of banking going forward thanks to the cost efficiencies that they offer. Unlike traditional banks, they can save substantial operating costs by not having to maintain physical branches.

Nowadays, I don't know a single person who _enjoys_ going to the bank, even if they're a priority customer that can skip the awfully long waiting lines. Bank's limited opening hours, which is limited to workdays when people have to attend their day job, is not helping either.

With the prevalence of smartphones and near-ubiquitous internet connections, I see fewer reasons why traditional banks are better, such as for legacy reasons or physical features like safe deposit box access.

The only major drawback for digital banks that I can think of is that if something happens to our account, we can only rely on the bank's (usually bothersome) customer service. There's no actual branch that we can visit to yell at the manager. This is compounded by the fact that with simple social engineering, it's relatively easy to phish people to get their login credentials.

# Credit Cards

Despite what some people say about the evil reputation of credit cards, I believe it's one of the most powerful financial tools that have almost no drawbacks when utilized properly. Those few drawbacks can also be easily mitigated.

## Why use credit cards?

There are two primary reasons why I use credit cards.

### It's just more profitable

If we're paying for anything in cash, we're almost literally leaving money on the table. Except in shady stores where there are credit card surcharges, the price of most goods and services are already taking into account fees that the merchants have to pay to banks or payment services to provide us with cashless payment options. If we don't utilize them, **we're paying for somebody else's usage of those payments**.

Although some people say that e-wallets are the next logical step of payment evolution (which is already happening in some countries such as the People's Republic of China), I beg to disagree: except during their early days where VC-funded promotions are in the rage, they don't provide many benefits compared to the good old credit (or even debit) cards, which had been reliably existing for decades now.

E-wallets are also more cumbersome because they require us to have a mobile device with a reliable internet connection and do top-ups when we want to use them. It's common to see queue lines are clogged up by people who realized they have insufficient balance and have to do a top-up on the spot.

E-wallets are also debit by nature, which means that whenever there's a fraud transaction that we don't approve of or someone created an honest mistake of charging us with an incorrect value, our money is gone until we ask the e-wallet provider to refund it for us.

This situation puts us at the mercy of the provider to process the refund. Using a credit card, on the other hand, we haven't paid for anything yet when we make a transaction, hence we have higher leverage and time to resolve any issues before we have to pay our bills.

At worst, I've experienced myself an occasion where a significant value of my top-up was not processed for _almost 3 weeks_ due to an unexplained issue on their side. The customer service was abysmal and not helpful at all during my inquiry.

### Helps us maintain our cashflow

Credit and debit card transactions provide us with electronic statements delivered via e-mail that can help us reconcile with our cash flow tracking and can serve as a future reference. In addition, because our transactions are rolled out into a single billing, it's easier to predict when we'll have to make the payment for our expenses. Even better, when the transactions are made near at or after the cut-off period, we don't have to pay for them until the next billing cycle, which can be useful sometimes.

## How to use credit cards properly

There is one golden rule that we must absolutely obey: **always pay our bills in full**. Never, ever carry a balance on your card. Treat it as if it's a debit card: use it only when you can actually afford to pay for something with cash.

If we're doing it that way, not only we can avoid interest (which as I mentioned in my [previous post](/money-talks-part-1/), is the single greatest destroyer of wealth), it also sets the notion that it's just a mere tool of payment, not a magic wand that can somehow allow us to purchase things that we cannot do otherwise.

What about annual fees? In my country, annual fees are weird: they kind of exist, but when we really dig through it, they're probably not. It's somewhat easy to request for annual fee removal through the bank's call center, and they will usually ask us to spend a relatively insignificant amount of spending to waive the fee altogether.

## Which credit cards to get

As I mentioned, merchants pay hefty fees to banks to be able to receive credit card payments. Thus, banks were able to pass some of those profits to customers in various forms, such as cashback and airline miles. Although the amount is somewhat negligible, then again, this is free money that we should not pass up.

I own several credit cards, but I primarily only use two: the one that's provided by my digital bank because they offer significant cash back for certain categories that are currently the best in the country, and one general-purpose card that's providing consistent airline miles for all expenses. Thanks to my minimal spending and COVID-19 pandemic at the time of this writing, unfortunately, I haven't been able to utilize my earned miles yet.

My suggestion is that you should apply for the best card you can afford **with regards to your income and spending level**. Going under will lose you the potential rewards while going higher will make it more expensive to own because of the higher level of minimum spending that you have to make to make you eligible for the annual fee waivers.

# Emergency Fund

After the basic ins and outs of our money are sorted, the first order of business is to have an emergency fund at hand. It's basically rainy day money that we can use to cover our emergency expenses without needing to dig through our longer-term investments, which we'll talk about in the next post. Think about unexpected things like layoffs, unexpected medical expenses, or any other mishaps that we'll inevitably encounter in our life.

The amount itself varies depending on two things: our base monthly expenses and our personal circumstances. Our _base_ expenses are the absolute bare minimum value we need to keep us alive and well-fed: housing (rent or mortgage), food, transportation, etc. Our actual monthly expenses are usually higher, and in times of emergency, We have to be able to trim down the more frivolous spendings.

The second factor to consider is our very own life circumstances. If you're single, doesn't have dependents such as retired parents or kids, or working in a secure job, you will not need as much as those who have a family to feed, live paycheck to paycheck, relies on freelancing job, or expect any other volatilities. The suggested number vary, but the rule of thumb is usually between 3 months at the very least and up to 1 year or more for those who require more safety net.

I'm keeping that stash in a money market fund which is generally liquid, has little risk of losses (we don't want to put our emergency fund in something that can go down in value just when we need it), and pays a decent amount of return. We can use time deposits as well, although most banks won't have better interest rates than the return of money market funds and can fine us for early withdrawal.

In the next post, I'll talk about what investments that I own and the reasons behind them. I'll also share about stock and mutual fund brokers that I use and why I chose them.
