Hi, my name is Wiratmika. In case you're wondering, yes, that's only a single word in my birth certificate.

I'm a self-proclaimed geek, a hardcore rationalist who likes to call myself a "binary artist", which actually is just a niftier term for "programmer". I occasionally drown myself in an eclectic mix of stuffs, such as playing guitar, consulting SMEs for their tech needs, wondering what life will be like if our world was engaged in a nuclear warfare, and other tidbits. People never believe me when I tell them I'm an introvert: I am really that quirky man in the family who always wishes the family gathering to end sooner.

Tell me a joke and we can be friends; I love good conversations!
