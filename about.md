This is a personal blog of [Wiratmika](//wiratmika.me). I realized that the best
way to eternalize moments and thoughts at certain point of our lives is to
contemplate them in writings. Everything written here is mostly unmoderated
version of rants or whatever going on my mind.

I am (in no particular order):

* Geek by design
* Eccentric rationalist
* Hardcore procrastinator
* Avid deadpan, pun, and sarcastic humorist
* Fan of highly-eclectic mix of culture (primarily Indonesian indie music,
  Japanese anime, nuclear warfare, everything about aeronautics and space
  exploration)
* Ambivalent antisocial who spend most of the time overthinking life and
  occasionally got drown in seas of random thoughts
* Awkward young man in the family who always wishes the family gathering to end
  sooner
* Binary artist, and eternal dreamer

I aspire to be someone who made positive impacts for mankind and particularly
for Indonesia, while actually make ends meet with that dream. How can life be
well worth living without challenges?

Enjoy my writings.
