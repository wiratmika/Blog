# Bapak: An Eulogy of How I Remember My Father

> "Nanti kalau bapak sudah tua dan kamu sudah sukses, bapak jenguk ke rumah kamu. Datengnya naik bajaj."
> "Bagi duit, le."
> "Bakal apaan pak?"
> "Beli CD."
> "Oke pak ini duitnya."
> "Terima kasih ya le. Bapak pulang dulu."
> "Naik apaan pak?"
> "Naik bajaj."
> "Masa naik bajaj? Ini aku ongkosin sekalian buat taksi."
> "Terima kasih ya le."

I will never forget that monologue. A weird, imaginary recount of what he's going to do in his twilight days, if he ever reached it. He tells it in both first- and third-person voices, and he is able to recount a perfect copy, word-by-word recital with same intonation. I myself used to correct him if he used the wrong word or phrase. That's an illustration of how absurd my dad is, and how he wishes me to be a successful person who does not forgot my roots. Now you know where I'm coming from.

My relationship with my father is, probably like everyone else, is not as rosy as a normal father-son relationship. I am never able to relate many stories in movies or novels. And the common thread of my relationship is regret. A lot of them.

I wouldn't consider my family to be particularly romantic or closely-knit one. The three males in our family are probably one of the least melancholic people that you can encounter. We only experience authentic family moment during our dinings and vacations.

There is one value that my father always hold dear but I am not able to fully practice yet: patience. Never once in my mind the memory of my father whining or complaining about something. He does not mind that hepatitis is slowly eating his body away, or his hearing kept degrading; he always live his life like there is nothing in this world who can haunt him. For every mistakes and failures that he made, especially in building business, it seems like it's just making his resolve stronger. Even until his very last breath. Few weeks before he passed away, he was planning to go to China for a business trip.

One of my last, precious memories of him when he was at this healthiest and happiest was during the time when I applied for an internship at a tiny, now-defunct startup. He drove me to Lotte Shopping Avenue, waited for me in the mall having an interview, and took me back home. I eagerly told him how the interview went. After all, it was my very first professional job interview. I didn't know what to expect, and, in this changing world, probably neither did he.

I can still feel the tears in my eyes when remembering that my mother used told that, a month before he passed away, my father used to call my name because he missed me. Living in a dorm so that I'll be closer to school, many times I didn't go home during weekend, even though I perfectly can.

Another thing is that I've not done many deeds that he asked me to do. As a typical boomer, he lives in an era of major transition. He has the foresight of what the future gonna looks like and what it takes to succeed, but never really have the acumen to execute it. Therefore, he relies on my brother and I to execute his vision. However, as a kid who can't be bothered to do his parent's errands, I always skip.

My message to you is that, while your family is still healthy, complete, and able to live together, enjoy it as best as you can; without caring about your family's individual traits. Mingle with them as often as you can. I hate to say this, but there is always a certain chance that your moment with your whole family today might the be last. Embrace it before you forgot how it feels. I know it because I have experienced it firsthand.

The scariest thing about losing someone is that they will become a memory that will slowly fades away from your mind. One day, you will forget about their figure.

Thank you my dear father, for without you I will not be borne into this marvelous, cruel world. For you have taught me a hard love that I will never receive with your own way. For making me realize how I must value partings and death not as the end, but the beginning of a new journey.

Farewell, my mentor. My guru. My dad.

See you on the dark side of the moon.
