Life is an Endless Series of Trade-offs

During the writing of my money talks series, I ponder upon something about the concept of where everything in life is just basically a long-running game of making decisions and living through it.

There's a saying that the biggest game in life, is life itself. Life is like an MMORPG game: you start with certain statistics points, you usually have to achieve certain goals, and every decision you make has consequences that will impact your gaming experience and the outcome.

What they don't tell you is that the decisions are not as apparent nor well programmed. The goals and metrics and never defined, and it is up to us to create one ourselves.

They don't tell you the stats etc. If you upgrade a weapon, the stats are clearly defined.

That doesn't apply to life. If I take this degree, what will I get? If I take the time to learn.

If I apply for this job?

If I marry this person?

Being an engineering manager, I am blessed with the opportunities to learn about decision-making and weighing trade-offs literally on daily basis. If there's one key takeaway from my work that I can readily apply to my everyday life, it's only one thing: there is no such thing as the perfect decision, and everything has its own trade-offs.

The key fallacy that I see is that if someone sees others have different opinions, then those people are wrong. Unfortunately (or fortunately), the world is an amalgamation is wildly varying perspectives and views. Those mainly came from life experience.

Take one of the biggest life decisions one can partake in: whether to have a child or not and when to have it. I see my friends complain a lot about being somewhat always broke due to the cost of bearing a child.

On the other hand, the same people are the ones who kept bragging about how cute their kids are, and what the -- I've seen people who are actually showing off the computer science books they bought for their children are who _not even been born yet_.

Despite the financial burden, having kids early certainly has advantages that many people are not talking about: the parents are relatively healthier, and the age gap is small which means they will have less of a generational gap and are likely able to correlate with their children better. This is my own anecdotal observation as it is difficult to quantify, but I see lots of parents who are considered "cool" is almost always those of younger parents.

What that means is that there is no perfect choice for everything. There is no right or wrong decision, it's just a spectrum that we can optimize for.

Your Environment Shapes Your Thinking
I was raised in an urbanization immigrant, middle-class family. My primary and secondary schools are private institutions that have many rich kids. However, back then I did not have the wealth nor courage to befriend them. My high school is a boarding, semi-military school that has students coming in from literally all provinces and economic backgrounds. I tend to gravitate toward people coming from rural areas because I'm somehow able to relate to them better. As a result, I never had the desire to live the lavish lifestyle that most people in my socioeconomic level do.
