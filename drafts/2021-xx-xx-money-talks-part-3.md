Investing is a topic that people, for some reason, love to have a discourse on. This is likely because, unlike personal expense and lifestyle preferences, investing is not considered taboo to talk about openly. People are more willing to share information about their investments than their mortgages and how much much they spend on shopping last month. In addition, investments are, to some extent, relatively easy to replicate and undo.

I intentionally discuss investments last because investing is the easiest to figure out in the bigger picture of personal finance. Good decisions can be easily derived using first principles thinking, simple math, and statistics. It does not need one to be uncomfortable with their emotions and doesn't require much time to execute and manage. Yet, it bears repeating that investing can only be effective after understanding and grasping the behavioral fundamentals.

# Investing Has Different Meaning for Each of Us

Everyone's life circumstances are different. Knowing your priorities will be among the most significant factors when determining why and how one should invest. Priorities inherently vary between people because everyone values things differently. For example, some people prefer to have children as early as they are able to. Some people prefer to forgo having a family, and spend time partying anytime they want. Despite the fact that people like to judge others, there's no right or wrong decisions; again it's just the function of different values.

There is, however, one thing to note: each values and preference always come with a set of tradeoffs. Case in point: married people with kids might lose out on savings early on, but they can earn joy from raising their kids. Having kids early is not always the optimal financial decision (unless they have rich parents to rely on), but they have a higher chance of surviving long enough to see ther kids thrive and bear their grandchildren.

On the other hand, people who prefer not to marry nor have kids will acquire greater independennce, but they might wonder during old age when they have no one to tend to except each other. All in all, before discussing what to invest in, one needs to understand what they value in life, and how it affects their financial goals.

## Setting up financial goals

Before we can dive deeper into investments, we need to understand *why* we invest in the first place. Investing without clear financial goals can be a slippery slope for two reasons:

1. Every investment has risk and return that highly depend on its timeframe and risk tolerance. Rore on that below.
2. It'll be more tempting to not save and invest for short-term pleasures due to a lack of longer-term needs. Being able to favor long-term needs than short-term ones is also known as delayed gratification.

Savings and investment goal does not have to be for making a material purchase. It can be for something intangible, like the ability to resign from a job without having to think about the financial consequences. It can also be for a peace of mind when artificial intelligence wiped a whole occupation, like how time and time again technology is able to do so. It can also being able to afford the absolute best education for one's children, without having them carry the burden of having student debt.

In my case, my long-term goals are to own complete freedom, options, and flexibility in the life that I want to live. I want a safety net that allows me to work on things I love or believe in instead of focusing on the pay or compensation. I want to be able to support my family, including my future children if I will ever have one. Education cost is among the few things that consistently surpass the inflation rate. I want my children to have all the opportunities they need to pursue their aspirations.

As a side note, I am trying my best to let go of material possessions cravings. I bought my dream car pretty early in my life. I later realized that no matter how I like cars (I watch tons of reviews of them just for entertainment), at the end of the day, they are just transportation tools to get you from point A to point B. Outside public transport, there are plenty of substitutes: bikes, ride-hailing, or even cheaper, easier-to-maintain cars. I closely follow technological gadgets, but I realized no matter how pricy a device is, it only makes one's life better up until diminishing marginal utility points. For example, in my experience, a tablet is a pretty cool device, but nothing that a notebook and phone cannot replace. There are some use cases like drawing that might warrant a tablet, but it's not for me at the time being.

Settings goals are crucial because, with them, it can be easier to determine which investment vehicles best suit your needs. The more specific your goal is, the better; you should have a close approximation of the amount and the time when it's needed, so you can determine which assets to invest in and why.

To re-iterate, *there's no such thing as "the best investment"*: it's always a trade-off between risk and return. Generally, the higher your risk-taking, the higher the return will be.

# Understanding Risk and Return Trade-offs

There are many studies on this topic, but the key takeaway you need to remember is that risk and return are linear. The higher return you want, the higher the risk will be. There is no getting around it. If there is an investment that promises high return and low risk, it is almost certainly a fraud; otherwise, everybody would be already rich by now.

1. Where you live right now because that will affect your tax residency and optimal investment strategy. I cannot go into details here because every country has different tax laws that it's impossible to go through. Still, in the next part, I will explain how I invest as an Indonesian living in Japan.
