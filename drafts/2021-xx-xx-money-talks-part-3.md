Investing is the most common topic that people, for some reason, love to have a discourse on. This is likely because, unlike personal expense and lifestyle preferences, investing is not considered taboo to talk about openly. People are more willing to share information about their investments than their mortgages. In addition, investments are, to some extent, relatively easy to replicate and undo.

I intentionally discuss investments last because investing is the easiest to figure out in the bigger picture of personal finance. Good decisions can be easily derived using first principles, simple math, and statistics. It does not need one to be uncomfortable with their emotions and doesn't require much time to execute and manage. Yet, it bears repeating that investing can only be effective after understanding and grasping the behavioral fundamentals.

# Investing is a Different Thing for Each of Us

Everyone's life circumstances are different. Knowing your priorities will be among the most significant factors when determining why and how one should invest. Priorities inherently vary between people because everyone values things differently. For example, some people prefer to have children at the early stage of their careers. Some people like to party all night and weekends long. The thing is, there's no such thing as the right or wrong decision for such things. Married people with kids might lose out on savings early on, but they can earn joy from raising their kids.

On the other hand, people who prefer not to marry nor have kids seem more independent, but I wonder how they will fare during old age when they have no one to tend to except each other. Therefore, before discussing what to invest in, understand financial goals and why they're essential.

## Setting up financial goals

However, before we can go into investments, we need to understand *why* we invest in the first place. Investing without clear financial goals can be a slippery slope for two reasons:

1. Every investment has risk and return (more on that below) that highly depend on its timeframe and risk tolerance, i.e., can you afford to lose the money.
2. It'll be more tempting to not save and invest for short-term pleasures due to a lack of longer-term needs, also known as delayed gratification.

A saving goal does not have to be a purchase. I'm saving most of that differences for investments for my long-term goals: to own complete freedom, options, and flexibility in the life that I want to live. I want a safety net that allows me to work on things I love or believe in instead of focusing on the pay or compensation. I want to be able to support my wife and children if I will ever have one. Education cost is among the few things that consistently surpass the inflation rate. I want my children to have all the opportunities they need to pursue their aspirations.

I am trying my best to let go of material possessions cravings. I bought my dream car pretty early in my life. I later realized that no matter how I like cars (I watch tons of reviews for entertainment), at the end of the day, they are just transportation tools to get you from point A to point B. Outside public transport, there are plenty of substitutes: ride-hailing and cheaper, easier-to-maintain cars. I closely follow technological gadgets, but I realized no matter how pricy a device is, it only makes one's life better up until diminishing marginal utility points. For example, a $2000 state-of-the-art OLED TV is nice to watch but not vastly different from a capable $500 TV.

Settings goals are crucial because, with them, it can be easier to determine which investment vehicles best suit your needs. The more specific your goal is, the better; you should have a close approximation of the amount and the time when it's needed, so you can determine which assets to invest in and why.

*There's no such thing as "the best investment"*: it's always a trade-off between risk and return. Generally, the higher your risk-taking, the higher the return will be.

# Understanding Risk and Return Trade-offs

There are many studies on this topic, but the key takeaway you need to remember is that risk and return are linear. The higher return you want, the higher the risk will be. There is no getting around it. If there is an investment that promises high return and low risk, it is almost certainly a fraud; otherwise, everybody would be already rich by now.

1. Where you live right now because that will affect your tax residency and optimal investment strategy. I cannot go into details here because every country has different tax laws that it's impossible to go through. Still, in the next part, I will explain how I invest as an Indonesian living in Japan.
2. How much risk can you stomach, i.e., Depends on the time horizon based on the above points.
