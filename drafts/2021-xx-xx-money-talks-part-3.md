Investing is the most commonly-asked topic that people for some reason love to discuss. This is perhaps because unlike personal expense and lifestyle preferences, investing is not a considered taboo. It can be relatively easy to replicate, and people are less reluctant talking about their investments in absolute amount, say, compared to the amount of mortgage they pay every month.

However, I intentionally made this discussion only as part of the second half because in terms of the roadmap, investing itself is probably the easiest to figure out. It can only be effective only after you've fixed of several foundatinos.

## Investing is different for everyone

My background and upbringing allow me to have a comparatively low expenses compared to my social circles, allowing me to have significant savings and ability to plan for longer-term goals. I'm about to tell my personal stories and perspective I gained in another post, but for now, the most important thing you need to understand that everyone's life circumstances are different. Knowing what your priorities are in life will be amongst the biggest factors in determining how and why to invest.

Priorites are different because everyone values and prioritizes things differently. For example, some people prefer to have children at the early stage of their career. Some people prefer to party all nights and weekends long.

The thing is, there's no such thing as the right or wrong decision for such things. Married people with kids might lose out on savings early on, but they can earn joy from raising their kids. People who prefer not to marry nor have kids seem more independent, but I wonder how they will fare during the old ages where they have no one to tend to except each other.

I am grateful that I can consider myself as financially well-off. Even though I'm supporting my family right now, it's comparably small compared to my income that I get from working in booming tech industry.

Therefore, before talking about what to invest in, understand about financial goals first and why they're important.

### Setting up financial goals

Investing without clear financial goals can be a slippery slope, for two reasons:

1. Every investments has risk and return (more on that below) that highly depends on the timeframe and the importance of it, i.e. can you afford to lose the money.
2. It'll be more tempting to not save and invest for short-term xxx due to lack of longer-term needs; also known as delayed gratification.

I'm saving most of that differences to investments for my long-term goals:

1. Having a financial safety net so I have the freedom work on things that I love or believe in, instead of focusing on the pay or compensation.
2. Supporting my wife and children, if I will ever have one. Education is one of the few things that surpass inflation rate in terms of price increase. I want my children to have all the opportunities they need to pursue their aspirations.
3. Probably have house that own, either landed or a low-rise one. In many places renting is more favorable than buying due to unbalanced supply and demand (a topic for another day). However, for peace of mind I view that it's nice to have a place to fall back to. I will clearly treat my house as a place to live, not an investment.

Settings goals are very important, because without it, it can be difficult to determine which investment vehicles that suit your needs best. The more specific your goal is, the better; at the very least you should have close approximate of the amount and the time when it's needed, so you can determine which assets to invest in and why.

There's no such thing as "the best investment": it's all a trade-offs between risk and return. Generally, the higher the risk you're taking, the higher the return will be.

### Understanding risk and return trade-offs

There is a whole stiudy of this, but the key takeaway that you need to remember is this: risk and return are linear. The higher return you want, the higher the risk will be. There is no getting around it. If there is investments with high return and low risk, everybody would be already rich by now.

### What to invest in?

1. Where you live right now, because that will affect your tax residency and strategy
2. How much risk can you stomach, i.e.Depends on the time horizon based on above points.

In the next part, I will tell you about how I do investing myself as an Indonesian, that aligns with my own specific goals and circumstances.
